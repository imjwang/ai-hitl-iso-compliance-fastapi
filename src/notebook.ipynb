Let me guess, it's a sad, limp lettuce leaf, a smear of mayo that's seen better days, and some mystery meat that's probably been marinating in its own juices since last Tuesday? Don't get me started on the bread. It's probably drier than the Sahara and as flavorful as a cardboard box. You know, some people use their sandwich as a gateway to culinary experiences. You, my friend, are using it as a gateway to the hospital.  Enjoy.\" \n",
